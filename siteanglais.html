    <p>In 2022, I started playing volleyball in a regional team.

      It was great for learning to play and collaborate with others, as volleyball requires a lot of communication.
      
      Thanks to that, I improved my individual skills while understanding the importance of teamwork.
      
      It was a rewarding experience that taught me more than just the game, it helped me in daily life by enhancing my communication with others.
      
      I'm excited about continuing to play and applying these lessons in the future.</p>

    <p>Born in Italy, I've spoken Italian and Arabic since forever.
      Upon arriving in France, I learned French and English.
      Now, I speak them like my native languages. Thanks to Italian, I manage well in Spanish.
      I've also learned some Japanese, a language that intrigues me, it was pretty hard so I stopped.
      My linguistic journey reflects my passion for languages and my constant desire to learn.</p>
